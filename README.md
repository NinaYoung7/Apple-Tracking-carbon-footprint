# Apple - Personalizing Carbon Emissions Data for Future Carbon Neutrality


Submitted by: **NING YANG**

Time spent: **40** hours spent in total

This project is a part of Course APANPS5800 - STORYTELLING WITH DATA in Columbia University.


## Description

There is so much data available about carbon emissions, but little information on people’s carbon footprint – daily, personalized, and measured. People would benefit from this individual information to change their behavior and compensate for their carbon emissions.
The project will use Apple’s customers’ data to help users measure their own carbon footprint. This, in return, will provide guidance to act. The
contribution of this project can also address Apple’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2030. 

As the opportunity we introduced in the Proposal, we conducted the exploratory data analysis, and put together an Infographic Story,which includes introduction, analysis, and conclusion, with **Tableau**.  We integrated text and graphics into a persuasive story targeting a non-technical audience in the final class and provided a clear, persuasive, and obvious takeaway for the consumer.

### Goal

As soon as the approvals for this project are cleared, the analytics team will launch invitations for the sprint review meetings to track the progress of each stage. These will be organized on a weekly basis to share the findings. The team will also perform peer-reviews with the development team to set the goals for the upcoming sprint. Let's unite our efforts for a more carbon-free environment.

## Summary

We visualize carbon emissions data at the national, U.S. state, and industry levels. We also analyze the changes in carbon emissions over time, starting with human activities and Apple's carbon emissions for each product. This gave me the experience of using **Tableau** from start to finish and learning how to build stories and communicate them clearly to a fee-based technical audience.
